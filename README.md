# OLADOC_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM_OOP
 A Console-based Hospital Management System can be developed in C++ using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. OOP allows for the creation of objects that model real-world entities, such as patients, doctors, and hospital departments, and the implementation of methods that define their behavior. In this system, the user interacts with the program through the console, inputting commands to perform actions such as adding a patient, scheduling an appointment, or viewing a patient's medical history. Classes can be used to represent different entities and encapsulate their data and behavior. Inheritance and polymorphism can be utilized to model the relationships between these entities and achieve code reusability. The system can be designed to store data in files, allowing for persistence of information between sessions. Implementing a Console-based Hospital Management System in C++ using OOP concepts provides a comprehensive and organized way to manage and track hospital operations.
